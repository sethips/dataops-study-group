Michael Dietz. State of the art in December 2017.

- [Deep detect](https://www.deepdetect.com/). Open source deep learning server.

- [DigitalOcean? Not quite yet](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-on-the-digitalocean-stack-not-quite-yet-5c408e7d1a41). August 2017 Medium article breaking down cost of Digital Ocean v. AWS. Summary: He used Google’s super CPU monster priced at $0.509/hr, and priced GPUs at $0.745/hr. This is well under DigitalOcean’s $0.952/hour for the High CPU and AWS $0.900/hour for the p2 instance.
