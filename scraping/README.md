# Scraping for data collection

# Group project
**Proposal:** Run scrapy spiders as a daemon process to scrape 
1) tweets, 2) Reddit and 3) Quora and store in PostgreSQL 
database.

## TODO
- select name
- discuss trigger mechanism
- sketch out database schema
- discuss high level API desire (to pull out of database)
- who/what is the consumer of our API- REST? CSV files?
